Make sure you are inside the server folder:
```
cd ./Task2/server
```
Install neccessary packages (Delete the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json before you proceed):
```
npm install
```
Run the backend server:
```
npm start
```
or
```
node index.js
```
And the backend server will run on localhost:8083

***In this folder, I provide the .env file which contain the secret for you so that you don't have to set up other stuff like database URI or custom secret keys***
